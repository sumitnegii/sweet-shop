# Sweet Shop Management System

A full-stack Sweet Shop Management System built using **Node.js, MongoDB, JWT, and React**, following **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles.
The application allows users to browse and purchase sweets, while admins can manage inventory securely.

---

##  Project Overview

This project is developed as part of a **TDD Kata** to demonstrate:

* RESTful API development
* Authentication & authorization
* Database integration
* Frontend SPA development
* Automated testing
* Clean coding practices
* Responsible AI usage

The UI is intentionally **minimal and functional**, focusing on correctness, clarity, and maintainability.

##  Tech Stack

### Backend

* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB (Mongoose)
* JWT (Authentication)
* bcryptjs (Password hashing)
* Jest + Supertest (Testing)

### Frontend

* React (Vite)
* React Router
* Axios
* Plain CSS / inline styles (minimal UI)

---

##  Features

### User

* Register & Login
* View available sweets
* Search sweets by name/category
* Purchase sweets (stock decreases)
* Logout

### Admin

* Add new sweets
* Update price & quantity
* Delete sweets
* Admin-only access control

---

##  API Endpoints

### Auth

* `POST /api/auth/register`
* `POST /api/auth/login`

### Sweets (Protected)

* `GET /api/sweets`
* `GET /api/sweets/search`
* `POST /api/sweets` (Admin)
* `PUT /api/sweets/:id` (Admin)
* `DELETE /api/sweets/:id` (Admin)

### Inventory

* `POST /api/sweets/:id/purchase`
* `POST /api/sweets/:id/restock` (Admin)

---

##  Testing (TDD)

* Tests written **before implementation**
* Clear **Red → Green → Refactor** workflow
* Jest used for unit & integration testing
* Supertest used for API testing

### Run tests

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

All core backend flows (auth, CRUD, purchase) are covered.

---

##  Frontend Pages

* `/login` – User login
* `/register` – User registration
* `/` – Dashboard (view & purchase sweets)
* `/admin` – Admin panel (CRUD operations)

Routes are protected using JWT and role-based access control.

##  Local Setup Instructions

### 1 Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Server runs on:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

Ensure MongoDB is running locally.

---

### 2 Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

## My AI Usage (Mandatory)

### AI Tools Used

* ChatGPT

### How AI Was Used

* Brainstorming API structure and endpoint design
* Generating initial test cases for TDD
* Debugging errors during development
* Improving code readability and structure
* Drafting documentation and README

### Reflection

AI was used as a **development assistant**, not a replacement.
All logic decisions, architecture choices, and debugging steps were **understood, verified, and implemented manually**.
AI significantly improved productivity and helped maintain clean, consistent code while following best practices.
